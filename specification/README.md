The "technical specification" of the elevator system is simple but most likely ambiguous and incomplete. It should only be regarded as a subset of the actual specification. Most of you will still be able to create a system adhering to specification just by reading the "technical specification".

The "complete specification" doesn't exist in written form. It's a metaphysical entity that can only be channeled into through the distorted mind of a teaching assistant. There are two ways to make sure you're interpreting the technical specification in a way that is compatible with the complete specification. The practical yet informal is to ask a student assistant. The student assistants are great! They have experience with interpreting the technical specification and have possibly answered the question you want an answer for before.

Before revealing the formal way to resolve specification ambiguities theres one more part of the specification that needs to be discussed. Namely the FAQ (TODO: insert link). The FAQ contains clarifications in regards to how the specification should be interpreted. There should never be conflicting answers between the FAQ and the technical specification, or between different FAQs.

If you're not satisified with the answer of a student assistant or believes that the issue at hand requires a formal explanation you should start reading the "old" FAQs. If no answer can be found you may fill out an issue following the guidelines (TODO: insert link). If found warrented your issue will result in a new FAQ or change in the techincal specification, and you will at least get a response from the teaching staff.

If this seem daunting to you, fear not. You can choose to not care about any of this. If you instead of reading formal specifications use your best intuition on how elevators should work and ask as many questions as you can come up with to the student assistants and your fellow students you will most likely come up with something thats pretty close to the complete specification as well.
